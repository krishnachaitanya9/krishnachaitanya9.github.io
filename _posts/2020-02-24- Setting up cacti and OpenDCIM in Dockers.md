I copied everything from https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/ubuntu-how-tos/how-to-install-cacti-on-ubuntu-18-04-lts-bionic-beaver.html

Now the problems I faced:

- Just ignore the problems you are facing, the starting warning and click next
- In the last dialog it will give you suggestions on how to escape those warnings. Follow them.
