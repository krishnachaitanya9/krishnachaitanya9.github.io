Agree or not, making your IDE beautiful and readable is important. I use PyCharm and CLion a crazy lot. These are my theme preferences:

Theme: One Dark Theme (I guess it's inspired by Atom. Before I used to use sublime, but God Atom is so good). Specially One Dark Vivid Italica  
Coding Font: Fira Code (Style Retina)  
Font Size: 16  

Enjoy Coding Folks!
