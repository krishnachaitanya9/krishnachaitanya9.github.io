I was terrified of recursion. When I was in Indian Institute of Science, I had gotten an idea to use recursive function. But failed drastically. Ultimately my manager asked me to implement something in that place and concentrate on it sometime else. When I came to CU Boulder, after attending one of the greatest professor's who will walk this face of earth: Prof Sriram Sankaranarayanan, in one of his assignments taught me how to conquer it. I will cherish it my entire life:

- Take special care of base requirement. Whenever you gotta return something.
- Whatever uses recursion can be saved in some way to obtain optimal substructure. So save it!
