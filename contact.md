Hello! My name is Kodur Krishna Chaitanya and I am a 2nd year Master's student in Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research interests are Deep Learning and Computer Vision and Robotics. This is my blog where I write my day-to-day encounters with the interesting projects that I do so that I remember them and maybe it can be useful to others too!
